ChordConstructor README
Handin: Final handin

Overview:
	My ChordConstructor consists of seven public classes.
	The App class instantiates the PaneOrganizer and the Scene, and calls the show() method on the Stage.
	The PaneOrganizer instantiates the BorderPane _root, the constructorPane, and the quitButton.
	The ChordConstructor class contains all of the buttons for selecting the key of the chords and the
		chords themselves. It instantiates the label, background (staff), audio, and buttons. It also
		creates the Key.
	The Key class contains all of the Notes, a LinkedList of Notes, and various other variables, including
		the quality (major/minor) of the scale and the type of accidental (s/f).
	The Note class contains all of the graphical information for each note, including the Ellipse _noteHead,
		Line _ledgerLine, Line _staffLine, and ImageView _accidentalImage. It also contains a getter
		method that returns the English name of the note (e.g. C sharp).
	The Constants class contains various class contains various dimensions and locations, as well as twelve 
		integers (0-11) representing each pitch class.
Design Choices:
	I chose to make the Key class contain all of the information about the scale so that it would be easy
		to retrieve the information in the ChordConstructor class.
	I chose to make the sharps and flats appear as accidentals of the notes rather than on a key signature
		because I thought that would be easier to implement.
	I chose to use a FlowPane to hold the buttons so that they would not go off-screen.
Known Bugs:
	After pressing a chord button several times, the audio seems to randomly stop working. It appears to 
		be a bug with JavaFX.
Extra Credit:
	Audio, clear button
